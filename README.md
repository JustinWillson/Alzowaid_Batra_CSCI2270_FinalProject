For the final project, Rowan Alzowaid and I will build upon Assignment 12 movies with hash tables. We plan to create a new and more robust algorithm for generating hashcodes for storing movies in the hash table. In addition, we will keep the original hashSum algorithm as a benchmark for how efficient different hashcode-generating algorithms are by keeping track of how many steps it takes for each algorithm to find a movie when the user requests it. The purpose of this project is to showcase how different algorithms compare in improving the efficiency and reliability of the hash table.
